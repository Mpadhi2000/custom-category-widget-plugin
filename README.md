## 🧠 For Recruiters & Reviewers

- This plugin is **100% developed from scratch** without relying on external widget plugins.
- It is built to **override missing theme support**, ensuring usability in **modern WordPress (FSE)** as well as classic themes.
- Includes proper use of:
  - WordPress APIs (`register_widget`, `register_sidebar`, `WP_Query`)
  - Widget form fields (with sanitization and validation)
  - `add_filter('use_widgets_block_editor', '__return_false')` to ensure **Widgets menu appears** in **Appearance**
